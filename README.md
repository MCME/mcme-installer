# MCME-Installer
Installer for the MCME Modpack

## Installer compiling:

### Windows:
The Windwos installer uses Inno Setup:
https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

Put the script.iss and the contents in the same folder and compile. Done!


### MacOS:
The MacOS Installer uses the Packages software:
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html

Let the software istall the contents into Library/MCME /mods and /resourcepacks via the payload tab. Then put the script.sh as post-installation script and compile. Done!
